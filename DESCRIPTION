Description: VarSleuth is an open-source tool for genomic variant analysis 
    and interpretation. It provides an integrated environment for 
    annotating, filtering, and interpreting genetic variants for whole 
    genome sequencing (WGS) and exome sequencing data. Incorporating the 
    ACMG guidelines, VarSleuth aims to offer improved accuracy and 
    usability for variant interpretation. It offers clinicians, geneticists, 
    and researchers a comprehensive solution for identifying pathogenic 
    variants and exploring their potential clinical impact.
